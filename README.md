# Our Stuff

### A Test Driven Developed Rails application for keeping an inventory of items in your home.

This is an app built out of personal necessity. My wife and I were moving to a smaller downtown condo and needed to get rid/give away a lot of big stuff. We wanted a way to easily track the items we were giving away and also allow our friends to claim (or call 'dibs') on those items. This app fit the bill.

The style is very basic, but that is by design. I imagined that we would be adding items via our iPhones vs any other way. So the key here was a super responsive, clean layout that would easily load on our phones.

# Contributions
This isn't something I plan on developing out much further, but if you feel like contributing, feel free to do the fork, contribute, push, MR thing. I'll welcome any additions with open arms.

Some things I want to add, but don't have time for:

1. Email notifications using Mandrill
2. Password resets using Mandrill/Devise (I know, I'm just being lazy, but remember your passwords people - not that hard...)
3. SMS notifications using Twillo (or the like)
4. A few more tests wouldn't hurt
5. Draper (or some view model layer) to clean up the UI a bit
